# Housing Data Analyzer

housingPriceAnalyzer will be a software tool project that predicts housing prices in Buenos Aires based on various factors and data analysis, it also is planned to provide some relevant information about different features in these houses/apartments.
It will be supported by some government information available here:
  - https://data.buenosaires.gob.ar/dataset/

This data may include location, square meters, number of bedrooms, amenities, some descrition on it (In spanish) and historical price trends. This project will be the main context for this course, in which I would like to apply all kinds of knowledge and skills acquired in these lessons, a lot of practice and mistakes will lead hopefuly to a functional software tool. 

One of the critical processes in this project will be data preprocessing and building a basic machine-learning model. The first includes a lot of data management and the use of some tools for this connection, processing, and interpretation for this second part, the model. 
Now, with all these evaluations, we have to choose an optimal model to reach this goal, it has to be tested, and refactored for improvement in its structure and maintainability. 

The construction of the GUI will also be evaluated, after ensuring operation through console input, the objective itself is that given certain relevant data, the final price of a home with these characteristics can be estimated, taking into account many economic and social factors.

The file shared in this first assignment is a draft project of the desired model, I did it in a course in the past and it seemed relevant to the use of this course, Unfortunately , the project is currently only available in Spanish. However, as I return to the project's core logic, I will provide a step-by-step translation and a new approach in the project documentation.

By the end, the real purpose of this exercise is to practice with different REs and get used to them, all the documentation and management are the keys to effectiveness  

Here is a basic UML to understand  https://lucid.app/lucidchart/0bb2b413-a3b8-42bc-9fb5-9a581cc820cc/edit?viewport_loc=-2098%2C-948%2C2942%2C1381%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_d09cc95e-f489-4add-8411-424b8a896b72

This repository will contain the source code, datasets, and documentation for this project.
